## VerdinCMS

**VerdinCMS** is a complete content management system written in PHP 8, built on the CodeIgniter 4 framework. It is designed to be lightweight, fast, secure, and fully customizable for developers who want full control over their content and codebase without relying on bloated or restrictive platforms.

VerdinCMS focuses on performance, clarity, and developer autonomy. It includes a flexible architecture, clean separation of responsibilities, and a minimal but functional default theme to get started quickly. The system offers AI-assisted content support, modular features, and a configuration-driven approach that avoids unnecessary complexity.

This project is suitable for personal websites, blogs, small- to medium-scale publishing platforms, or any project that requires an efficient and modern PHP-based content management backend.

### Philosophy

VerdinCMS is built for developers who value control and transparency. It avoids the plugin bloat of other CMS platforms, focusing instead on code quality, simplicity, and extendability. Configuration files are human-readable. The codebase is organized in a way that respects separation of concerns and follows consistent design patterns.

It is intended to be understandable, customizable, and ready to deploy on modern PHP servers with minimal setup. Developers are encouraged to fork, modify, and adapt VerdinCMS to their specific needs without being locked into a proprietary ecosystem.
